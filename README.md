# Simple Hello World endpoints

1. I have created two simple REST endpoints as part of this project.
One of them uses the standard **spring-starter-web** artifact to return Hello World and the other endpoint uses publisher type Mono of
**spring-starter-webflux** project to return the same.
   
2. It also contains 2 sample unit tests to test both these REST endpoints.
